## First homework

The task was to create a project that replicates queue behavior.

I have been using the JetBrains Webstorm IDE, so to start the project you need to launch it on a server by Webstorm. To do this you need to open the *index.html* file and click the icon (in the upper right corner) of the browser you use (personally I used Chrome).

Enjoy!
